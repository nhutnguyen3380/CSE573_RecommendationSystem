## Evaluations

* After training using 5-fold cross-validation, our Neural Collaborative Filtering model resulted in an RMSE of 0.7923.  
* After training using 5-fold cross-validation, our Matrix Factorization model resulted in an RMSE of 0.8767.  
* The Neural Collaborative Filtering model had the lower RMSE and performed better than our Matrix factorization model that implemented the Singular Value Decomposition algorithm. You can run the code in our code directory to view our models and view the RMSE.
