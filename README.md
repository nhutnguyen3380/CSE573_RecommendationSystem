# CSE573_RecommendationSystem
This is Group 7's movie recommendation system. The data we used to train and test our model is the 1M MovieLens dataset, and we implemented both a matrix factorization model and a neural collaborative filtering model. The Python libraries that we used are Surprise, PyQt5, Tensorflow, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Numpy to implement our models and UI. Use the subdirectory called code to view the code for our demo, data has the 1M MovieLens dataset, and evaluations have our evaluations.
